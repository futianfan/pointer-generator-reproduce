Abstractive Summarization
======================

The repository is a reproduction of ACL 2017 paper *[Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368)*.

It heavily replied on the repository [here](https://github.com/becxer/pointer-generator). 

Regarding preprocessing and evaluation (ROUGE score), I use their code with small modification.

# Model
model.py: Regarding model, i reconstruct the code using Tensorflow. It support (1) Pointer-Generator and (2) Coverage Mechanism

# Train & Validation & decode
run.py: support checkpoint.
